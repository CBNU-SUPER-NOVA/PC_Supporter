## PyInstaller License Information
This project uses PyInstaller to package the application into an executable format.

PyInstaller is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 (or later), with a special exception for the bootloader. This exception permits the distribution of executables created with PyInstaller without applying the full terms of the GPL to the entire application.

Bootloader Exception:
The authors of PyInstaller grant you unlimited permission to link or embed the compiled bootloader and related files into combinations with other programs, and to distribute those combinations without any restriction coming from the use of those files. However, the General Public License restrictions still apply to the PyInstaller code itself, particularly when it is not linked into a combined executable.

For more information, please refer to:

- GNU GPL v2 License: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
- PyInstaller documentation: https://www.pyinstaller.org/
In summary, executables generated using PyInstaller can be freely distributed without requiring the entire project to comply with the full terms of GPLv2.
